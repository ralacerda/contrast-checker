# Multiple Color Contrast Checker

## Overview

The Multiple Color Contrast Checker is a web application designed to help you assess and verify color contrast according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The app allows you to check the contrast between multiple foreground and background colors, providing a clear indication of whether the contrast ratios meet the WCAG standards.

## Features

- Input and manipulate foreground and background colors: Add, delete, clone, and move colors to easily create different combinations.
- Evaluate contrast ratios: The app calculates and displays the contrast ratios between foreground and background colors.
- Pass/Fail indication: The results are clearly indicated, showing whether the contrast ratios meet the minimum WCAG standards.
- Large text consideration: The app takes into account the specific contrast requirements for larger text, ensuring readability.
- Preview of color combinations: The app provides a live preview of the selected foreground and background colors, showing the text and background with the chosen colors.

## Usage

1. Open the [Multiple Color Contrast Checker](https://multiple-contrast-checker.netlify.app/) in your web browser.
2. Use the interface to add or modify foreground and background colors.
3. The app will calculate and display the contrast ratios in the result matrix.
4. Colors that meet the WCAG standards will be indicated as passing, while failing combinations will be flagged.
5. Adjust the colors as needed to achieve the desired contrast ratios.

## Limitations

Please note that while this app helps assess color contrast, it does not account for other factors such as font weight, size, or font family, which can also impact text readability. Use this tool as a starting point for evaluating color contrast, but consider additional factors for a comprehensive assessment of accessibility and readability.
