  <p class="mb-1">
    This app assists in checking color contrast of multiple foreground and
    background color combinations. It displays a result matrix indicating
    whether the contrast ratios meet the WCAG standards. The recommended minimum
    ratio is 4.5:1 for most cases, ensuring readability, while a ratio of 3:1 is
    suitable for larger text.

    Please note that color contrast is just one aspect of accessibility and
    readability. Factors such as font weight, family, size, and other design
    choices also impact text legibility. While this app helps assess color
    contrast, please consider multiple factors for a comprehensive evaluation of
    accessibility and readability.
